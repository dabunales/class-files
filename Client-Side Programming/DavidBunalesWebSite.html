	<h3>Playing Guitar</h3>
	<p>I use to play in my High School Band. I've always been interested in music. My father had bought me my first guitar for my 16th birthday. I listen mainly to Rock or Metal genre of music. I've learned a couple of songs. The first song I ever learned was One Step Closer by Linkin Park. 
	I have a Mudvayne Tablature book for their "End of All Things to Come" cd. </p>
